# GeoQuiz
GeoQuiz is the first app from Android Programming, The Big Nerd Ranch Guide

This app was created using Android Studio

GeoQuiz is an app that quizzes the user on geography facts.  The user can decide on the validity of a fact by selecting
either the true or false buttons.  If the user does not know the answer, he/she may choose the cheat button which starts
another activity that displays the correct answer.  GeoQuiz will report to the main activity if the user selected the cheat
button and will display a message for cheating.  

GeoQuiz supports both portrait and landscape modes.
